Since I am more familiar with using libraries for data science tasks I am going to try and use some of the Go stuff that is out there for those tasks ie [this](https://github.com/sjwhitworth/golearn) library, [this](https://github.com/go-echarts/go-echarts) data viz library or [this](https://github.com/go-gota/gota) data wrangling library. Besides that I will obviously keep learning the basics as I go. 

Go_exercises is where I will keep my fundamental go learning stuff for now. Go_math is where I will keep my data sciency stuff that is done in GO.
