I also think learning terraform and being able to use it beter will be of use so I will be focusing on learning terraform as well and using this directory to hold the terraform stuff I make. In this section I still need to figure out how to best implement Docker. I will also try and build terraform scripts to build docker images etc. all with practice I will get the idea of how this whole repo will look..
