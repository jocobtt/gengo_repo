I also think learning terraform and being able to use it beter will be of use so I will be focusing on learning terraform as well and using this directory to hold the terraform stuff I make. In this section I still need to figure out how to best implement Docker. I will also try and build terraform scripts to build docker images etc. all with practice I will get the idea of how this whole repo will look..

[This Article](https://learnk8s.io/blog/get-start-terraform-aks) provides a cool example on how to use Terraform for AKS so I will try and use this as an example. Here is the [git repo](https://github.com/learnk8s/terraform-aks) for said project. Another [resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00r9C8rWsK8) I will use is the linked video put before. Where they go through kubernetes the hardway using terraform.
