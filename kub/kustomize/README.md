This is a repo for me to try and get a solid understanding of how to use kustomize. The majority of the tutorials I will use come from the github examples located [Here] (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/tree/master/examples). If there are any other tutorials I find I will also link them here. The majority of the tutorials in the github repo I am using utilize mktemp, so whether I will have actual files to push alongside this README file is yet to be decided.
