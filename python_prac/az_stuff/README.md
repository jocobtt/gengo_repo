This is a project where I am attempting to use create an Azure OCR environment on Kubernetes in a simple and easy to use fashion. Something that is low cost architecture but will always remain on. 


It will also have a jupyter notebook deployment that is ready to use and inside of the cluster as well. 

Ways to improve this project/to do's:

- Talk to shannon about what to plug it in to from a sas side of things 
- Get dockerfile working just right 
- make a separate namespace for jupyter vs ocr 
- fully figure out ocr_config manifest 
- plug it in with azureml - to manage ocr models
- mess with my auto scaler for cluster work demand etc. 
- tie it in with some other way to help manage the cluster easier..? Maybe openshift?
